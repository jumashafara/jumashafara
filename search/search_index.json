For example, probability is widely used in financial transactions, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/07/30/7-basic-statistics-concepts-every-data-scientist-should-know/#2-central-tendency-understanding-the-average","title":"2. Central Tendency: Understanding the Average","text":"<p>Central tendency refers to measures that summarize a dataset by identifying its center. The three common measures of central tendency are:</p> <ul> <li>Mean: The arithmetic average of all values.</li> <li>Median: The middle value when the data is arranged in order.</li> <li>Mode: The most frequently occurring value.   These metrics help in understanding the typical value within a dataset.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2025/07/30/7-basic-statistics-concepts-every-data-scientist-should-know/#3-variability-measuring-data-spread","title":"3. Variability: Measuring Data Spread","text":"<p>Variability describes how spread out or dispersed the data points are in a dataset. Key measures include:</p> <ul> <li>Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values.</li> <li>Variance: Measures how far each data point is from the mean.</li> <li>Standard Deviation: The square root of variance, providing a more interpretable measure of spread.   High variability can indicate noise or inconsistencies in data, which might lead to overfitting in machine learning models.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2025/07/30/7-basic-statistics-concepts-every-data-scientist-should-know/#4-relationship-between-variables-correlation-and-causation","title":"4.
