Programming is a field where you\u2019re constantly picking up new  languages, frameworks, and concepts. That\u2019s why Barbara Oakley\u2019s book Learning How to Learn struck such a chord with me \u2014 many of its lessons mirror what I see daily in my students.</p> <p>Here are the biggest takeaways, both for learners and for those of us guiding them.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/07/30/what-teaching-programming-taught-me-about-learning--lessons-from-learning-how-to-learn/#1-coding-needs-both-focused-and-diffuse-thinking","title":"1. Coding Needs Both Focused and Diffuse Thinking","text":"<p>When students first dive into programming, they think it\u2019s all about grinding through problems line by line. That\u2019s the focused mode \u2014 deep concentration on debugging or writing code. But breakthroughs often happen in the diffuse mode \u2014 during a walk, in the shower, or while resting.</p> <p>I always remind my students: step away from the keyboard sometimes.

Instead, you form chunks \u2014 reusable mental patterns like loops, if statements, or functions. Once a chunk is mastered, it becomes automatic, freeing up mental space for bigger problems.</p> <p>This is why I encourage hands-on coding exercises. Each practice session strengthens those chunks until writing code feels natural.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/07/30/what-teaching-programming-taught-me-about-learning--lessons-from-learning-how-to-learn/#3-spaced-practice-beats-cramming","title":"3. Spaced Practice Beats Cramming","text":"<p>Many learners try to \u201ccram\u201d a whole programming language in a week. But coding mastery doesn\u2019t come from binge-learning \u2014 it comes from spaced repetition. The more you revisit and practice concepts over time, the deeper they stick.</p> <p>For example, revisiting recursion or data structures in multiple projects cements them far better than a single crash-course.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/07/30/what-teaching-programming-taught-me-about-learning--lessons-from-learning-how-to-learn/#4-sleep-is-debugging-for-the-brain","title":"4.

I\u2019ve found the Pomodoro technique \u2014 working in 25-minute sprints \u2014 is a game-changer.</p> <p>And instead of obsessing over the final project, I tell learners to focus on the process: just write code for 25 minutes.
