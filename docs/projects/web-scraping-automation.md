# Automated Web Scraping Pipeline

A robust, scalable web scraping solution designed to collect, process, and store data from multiple sources with automated scheduling and monitoring.

## Project Overview

This project addresses the need for reliable, automated data collection from various web sources. The pipeline handles dynamic content, implements respectful scraping practices, and provides data quality assurance.

## Architecture

### Data Collection Layer
- **Scrapy Framework**: High-performance web scraping
- **BeautifulSoup**: HTML parsing and data extraction
- **Selenium**: Dynamic content handling
- **Rotating Proxies**: IP rotation for large-scale scraping

### Data Processing
- **Data Validation**: Schema validation and quality checks
- **Data Transformation**: Cleaning and standardization
- **Duplicate Detection**: Intelligent deduplication algorithms
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery mechanisms

### Storage and Orchestration
- **PostgreSQL**: Structured data storage
- **Apache Airflow**: Workflow orchestration and scheduling
- **Monitoring**: Real-time pipeline monitoring and alerting

## Current Status

- âœ… Core scraping framework implemented
- âœ… Data validation and processing pipeline
- ðŸ”„ Advanced scheduling and monitoring features
- ðŸ“‹ Performance optimization and scaling

## Challenges Addressed

- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful scraping with configurable delays
- **Dynamic Content**: JavaScript-rendered page handling
- **Data Quality**: Comprehensive validation and cleaning
- **Scalability**: Distributed processing capabilities

## Future Enhancements
